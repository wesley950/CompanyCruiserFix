# Lethal Company Cruiser Steering Fix

This mod tries to make the company cruiser steering more accessible by returning the steering wheel to its initial position when you release the turn keys (A, D). Even though the steering wheel model might not return back to the original rotation, the truck stops turning.

## Downloading and Installation

To download:
 - Click [here](https://github.com/wesley950/CompanyCruiserSteeringFix/actions)
 - Select the most recent workflow run
 - Scroll down to the artifacts and click to download
   
To install it, simply copy the .dll file included in the zip file you downloaded to the `plugins` folder of your BepInExPack installation.

## Required mods

This mod also has [LobbyCompatibility](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BMX/LobbyCompatibility/) as a requirement so I recommend you to install it to an [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) profile instead of your root game directory.

To install to a separate profile, you can create a new one on r2modman, install [BepInExPack](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/), open the settings of the profile, `Browse data folder`, go to `Lethal Company > profiles > [name of profile you created] > BepInEx > plugins` and paste the .dll file there.

P.S.: sorry for bed england and messy instructions, i'm tired
